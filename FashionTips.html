		<h4 class="FTtop">An important thing to remember is that the main goal of sustainability when it comes to fashion is to
			buy LESS, and limit the consumerism that brought us to this point at all.</h4>
		<h2> Here are some tips to help YOU on your sustainability journey</h2>
		<h3>Shop your own closet!</h3>
		<p class="FTp">I know it sounds crazy, because all the media around us is all about what new stuff is in and where you
			can get it, but just taking a second to go through your own closet and find old clothes that might still fit you and things
			that might fufill the trends were all chasing now!</p>
		<h3>Be super intentional with all your shopping!</h3>
		<p class="FTp">For the vast majority of Americans fast fashion is the most accessible way to get clothes. No one should
			be deprived of feeling good about their personal style, but when you shop fast fashion stores like Forever 21, Shein,
			and H&M. So when shopping these places think of things like what value will it add to your personal style, and could you
			find similar things through more ethical avenues or even make it yourself.</p>



		<h3> Find different ways to get new clothes</h3>
		<p class="FTp"> A great and accessible way to get new clothes is to thrift! Thrift stores have ample inventory for great
			prices, and they can also vary in price point and the items they carry- so there is something for everyone! In this way
			instead of supporting the fashion industry who's methods to produce new items hurts the environment and its laborers.</p>
